 <li>Write a C++ program that will generate three sets of RSA keys. Make sure primes p, q and key e are numbers that are greater than 10000</li>

</ol>




<ol start="2">

 <li>Write a program that will encrypt or decrypt a plaintext number using RSA. Namely, the program will ask the user to input a number for plaintext, e or d(depending on encrypting or decrypting) and n. The ciphertext will be a number. The recovered plaintext number will be the same as the original plaintext number. The program MUST use the keys generated in part 1 above.</li>
